# Ocean Library Documentary!
Hello! Welcome to Ocean Library

### What is Ocean Library?
• Ocean Library is a Lightweight, mobile-friendly ui library that has all the necessary components for scripts.
• While it may not be much, more features would come in the future as Ocean Library is still in early development.

With that being said, let's get started on how to use the library.

### 1. Booting up the Library
• This is necessary for the UI Library to work. It should be placed before anything else.

```lua
local UILibrary = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/screengui/oceanlib/refs/heads/main/Library.lua",true))()
```
